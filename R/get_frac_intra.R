# get fraction of intra-facility pairs for different snv thresholds
# dists - output of get_snv_dists - will want to change either the name of this argument or the other one so the arguments always mean the same input
# threshs - what snv thresholds to use #some vector of numbers, max number isn't > max snv distance or negative
# what if we call it snv_dists? because the other one is getting snv_dists?

#' Get fraction of intra-facility pairs for different snv thresholds
#'
#' @param snv_dists the output object of the get_snv_dists function
#' @param threshs SNV thresholds to use
#' @param dists a SNV distance matrix returned by the dist.dna function from the ape package
#' @param locs a named vector of locations of isolates (e.g. facility of isolation), with the name being the sample ID
#' @param pt a named vector of patient that isolate was taken from with the name being sample ID (optional)
#'
#' @return fraction of intra-facility pairs for different snv thresholds, lowest threshold represents lowest snv_dist in your data
#' @export
#'
#' @examples either input a snv_dists object that is the output of the get_snv_dists function or input a SNV distance matrix (made by ape::dists.dna) and a named vector of isolate locations and optionally isolate patient IDs.
