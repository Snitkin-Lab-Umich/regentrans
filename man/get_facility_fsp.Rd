\title{Make facility x facility matrix with Fsp values. Calculates fst as described in Donker et al. 2017}
\usage{
get_facility_fsp(fasta, locs, form = "matrix")
}
\arguments{
\item{locs}{locations names for pairwise comparison}

\item{form}{can be "long" or "matrix", default is matrix. Determines output format}

\item{snp_dist}{ape DNAbin object (i.e. from fasta file of SNPs) using read.fasta}
}
\value{
matrix of facility x facility matrix with Fsp values. Only bi-allelic sites. Fsp values bween 0 (HP=HS) and 1 (Hp = 0)
}
