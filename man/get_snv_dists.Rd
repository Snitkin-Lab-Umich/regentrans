\title{Get matrix of inter- and intra-facility pariwise snv distances}
\usage{
get_snv_dists(dists, locs)
}
\arguments{
\item{dists}{a SNV distance matrix returned by the dist.dna function from the ape package}

\item{locs}{a named vector of locations of isolates (e.g. facility of isolation), with the name being the sample ID}
}
\value{
a data.frame of isolate pairs, their SNV distance, and labeled as either inter- or intra-facility pairs. If pt_trans_net provided will return both direct transfer and indirect flow metric for each facility pair.
}
