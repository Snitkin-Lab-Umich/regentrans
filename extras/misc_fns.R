# functions to include in the regional genomic transmission analysis package

# some notes:
# we might want to change the function names (should start with a verb, be informative and not too long)
# we might want to change the format/colnames of the output as well
# good to include checks to see if the input is correct (within the function; can have a separate script for all check functions) and unit tests to check the functions (also in a separate script; we'll hopefully find bugs this way!)
# we'll want to make some arguments optional - i've tried to note where this will be, because they're not always optional now
# we'll want to be consistent with what arguments are called across functions (same name = same input)
# you'll have to put the package name in front of functions that come from a different package 

# compare pairwise snv distances returned by ape::dist.dna() using pairwise.deletion = T and F

# get intra- and inter-facility pairwise snv distances (might want to change this name to explain better what we're outputting)
# dists - snv distance matrix returned by dist.dna
# locs - locations of isolates (e.g. facility of isolation) 
# pt - patient isolate was taken from (optional; will remove pairwise snv distances between the same patient)
